### micro:bit Capacitive Touch (P1 + Iron Tape)

A simple micro:bit project that uses Pin P1 as a capacitive touch sensor. Touching an electrode made from iron tape triggers LEDs and a tone. Holding the touch for ~8 seconds stops the sound. Only tested with iron tape, but should work with other conductive materials. Part 1 of an Engineering Design MITES Saturdays project to build an alarm that shuts off after users stretch for a set amount of time.

#### How to Use
- Connect your conductive material to P1.
- Download the included .hex file to your micro:bit.
- Touch the tape to activate the sensor.
